Name: Urban Delineation DLR - WSF
BYOAID: wsf-urban-delineation-dlr
Description: |
  This Urban Delineation algorithm delineates urban clusters using a method developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The algorithm based on this method is integrated here in the form of Docker developed in DLR.
  Integrated algorithm utilizes the latest version of the WSF population dataset at a resolution of 10 meters. This dataset is available for reference years 2016-2023. The WSF population dataset is provided by the German Aerospace Center and describes the spatial distribution of the human population. Presently, this dataset is accessible for Kenya. Datasets for Bolivia, Chile, and Myanmar will be incorporated once the necessary data becomes available. 
  User-defined area of interest (City of interest) is defined from selection of 34 cities within all four countries where the population exceeded 200000 inhabitants in 2015 by [GHS Functional Urban Areas](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/download.php?ds=FUA)
  
  To run the DLR WSF Urban Delineation, navigate to [EDC Browser](https://browser.eurodatacube.com/?zoom=10&lat=41.9&lng=12.5&fromTime=1970-01-01T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&toTime=2024-05-03T07%3A55%3A31.894Z&algorithm=settlement-extent), 
  select the required input parameters and follow the check-out wizard to complete your order.
