Name: E8 indicator
BYOAID: e8-indicator
Description: |
  The indicator E8 measures COVID-19 lockdown effects on output inventory level at finished goods production sites. To contain COVID-19 pandemic, EU Member States have taken a restricitve measures. According to 
  [EUROSTAT](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20200612-2), these imposed measures had in general a negative effect on demand and thus on industrial production in many areas.
  
  At the logistic areas operated at the production sites such as motor vehicle manufacturing, the large number of metal objects (e.g. machinery, vehicles) produces a strong signature in the radar backscatter signal. 
  The observations provided by the Synthetic Aperture Radar satellites such as the C-band [Copernicus Sentinel-1](http://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1) or the X-band Iceye 
  satellites permit comparative measurements between 2019 and 2020 of the average backscatter signal at the output logistic areas.

  The output of the indicator E8 algorithm is a CSV file containing statistics of Sentinel-1 backscatter signal for selected aoi and time period.

  To generate the indicator E8 data, navigate to [EDC Browser](https://browser.eurodatacube.com/?zoom=4&lat=74.70645&lng=-45.84855&fromTime=1970-01-01T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&toTime=2021-10-22T14%3A36%3A31.329Z&algorithm=e8-indicator),
  select the required input parameters and follow the check-out wizard to complete your order. Produced data will be uploaded directly into your JupyterLab environment on EDC.
