# Urban Delineation

## Short description 

This Urban Delineation algorithm delineates urban clusters using a method developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The algorithm based on this method is integrated here in the form of Docker developed in DLR.
Integrated algorithm utilizes the latest version of the WSF population dataset at a resolution of 10 meters for reference years 2016-2023.  

## WSF Data products

The WSF population dataset is provided by the German Aerospace Center and describes the spatial distribution of the human population. Presently, this dataset is accessible for Kenya. Datasets for Bolivia, Chile, and Myanmar will be incorporated once the necessary data becomes available.

#### WSF products parameters
Spatial resolution: 10m

Coord. system: WGS84 coordinate reference system (EPSG:4326)

Reference years: 2016-2023


## Results 

Shapefile containing delineated polygons representing Urban Clusters within the selected city.

The polygons are projected onto the WGS84 coordinate reference system.
