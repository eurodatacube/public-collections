Name: High-Resolution Snow & Ice Monitoring; Persistent Snow Area
Description: |
  The High-Resolution Snow & Ice Monitoring service (HR-S&I) is part of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). The snow aspect of the service provides products 
  measuring Snow cover (FSC, FSTOC, FSCOG, GFSC), Snow state conditions (WDS, SWS) and persistent snow area (PSA). There are also ice products that measure ice cover 
  (RLIE) and aggregated river and lake ice extent (ARLIE).

  More information about the data can be found [here](https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/biophysical-parameters/high-resolution-snow-and-ice-monitoring) and
  the snow products user manual is located [here](https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/hrsi-snow-pum). 

  The Persistent Snow Area (PSA) product is generated annually from FSC products and provides the extent of persistent snow cover for that year (the area where snow is 
  present throughout the hydrological year).
