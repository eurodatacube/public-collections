Name: JAXA's Public-health Monitor and Analysis Platform (JPMAP)
Description: |
   This is in cooperation with research institutes including universities and international organizations.EORC
   developed a user-friendly web-based system, JAXA's (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) Public-health Monitor 
   and Analysis Platform (JPMAP), which distributes satellite-derived environmental information, such as rainfall,
   shortwave radiation, soil moisture, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), aerosol optical thickness 
   (AOT), land surface temperature (LST), and altitude. The system was designed for users to download the data 
   and utilize it without any additional data processing. Users can request data with a specific geographic 
   location and time interactively via the website and then use the data for epidemiological analyses.
   EORC conducts research on the utilization of these satellite-derived environmental information 
   for the mitigation of infectious diseases such as malaria or dengue fever through proactive 
   prevention measures based on the result of epidemic risk analysis in collaboration with related agencies.
