Name: Truck Detection
BYOAID: truck-detection
Description: |
  The Truck Detection algorithm detects the number of moving trucks along roads using 10m resolution Sentinel-2 level 2A data.
  The author Henrik Fisser (henrik.fisser@t-online.de), developed this algorithm (with the title: Truck detection – Sensing trade from space) in the context of the Euro Data Cube COVID-19 edition of Sentinel Hub’s custom script contest.
  The algorithm exploits the small offset between Sentinel-2 bands which causes moving objects to appear as rainbows in RGB images allowing the detection and mapping of moving trucks.  
  The output of the algorithm is **point vector data ( GeoPackage (.gpkg) format)** with the coordinates of the detected trucks, **dates** of detected trucks and the **valid road area** as attributes. More information regarding input and output specifications can be found under [additional information](https://collections.eurodatacube.com/truck-detection/readme.html).
