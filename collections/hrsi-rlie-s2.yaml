Name: River and Lake Ice Extent - Sentinel 2
OpenEOPID: RIVER_AND_LAKE_ICE_EXTENT_SENTINEL2
Description: |
  The River and Lake Ice Extent - Sentinel 2 (RLIE S2) product is part of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS), 
  pan-European High Resolution Snow and Ice Monitoring [(HR-S&I)](https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/biophysical-parameters/high-resolution-snow-and-ice-monitoring) Ice product suite.The River and Lake Ice Extent (RLIE) products measure the presence of ice in rivers and lakes described by the EU-HYDRO network database, in particular the area of snow-free or snow-covered ice. 
  The RLIE S2 product is released in near real time for the entire EEA39 zone based on the revisit time of the Sentinel 2 constellation, and it is generated at a spatial resolution of 20 m x 20 m.  Because it is time critical for several applications, every effort is made to provide near real time ice products between 6 and 12 hours after the data sensing time. 
  More information about the RLIE S2 product methodology and workflow is outlined in the [product user manual](https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/hrsi-ice-pum)
