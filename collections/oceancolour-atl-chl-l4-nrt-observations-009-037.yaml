Name: OCEANCOLOUR_ATL_CHL_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_009_037
Description: |
  OCEANCOLOUR_ATL_CHL_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_009_037 is one of the ocean products provided by [Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS)](https://marine.copernicus.eu/).
  This product is delivered as daily NRT, L4 chlorophyll-a product of 1km resolution over the Atlantic, based on the merging of the sensors SeaWiFS, MODIS, MERIS, VIIRS-SNPP&JPSS1, OLCI-S3A&S3B.  
  L4 products are also called cloud free products, and are generated by applying space-time interpolation methods to fill in missing data values. 
  NRT products are operationally produced daily, one day after satellite acquisition providing the best estimate of the ocean colour variables at the time of processing 
  and after a few days superseded by Delayed Time (DT) files as soon as they are available to provide better quality.
