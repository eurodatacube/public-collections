Name: Urban Delineation - WSF
BYOAID: wsf-urban-delineation
Description: |
  Urban delineation algorithm classify and delineate urban clusters by typologies. Method was developed by Joint Research Centre (JRC) and described in Atlas of Human Planet 2019.
  This version of the Urban Delineation algorithm has been adapted to utilize the WSF2019population dataset at a resolution of 10 meters. The WSF2019population dataset is provided by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and describes the spatial distribution of the human population. This dataset is currently available for Bolivia, Chile, Kenya and Myanmar.
  User-defined area of interest (aoi) per order is limited to 10.000 km2
  
  To run the WSF Urban Delineation, navigate to [EDC Browser](https://browser.eurodatacube.com/?zoom=6&lat=47.44295&lng=10.71167&fromTime=1970-01-01T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&toTime=2020-01-01T17%3A32%3A46.781Z&algorithm=wsf-urban-delineation), 
  select the required input parameters (Country, Area of interest, Minimum Area of Urban Patches and Threshold for Total Population in Urban Patches) and follow the check-out wizard to complete your order.
